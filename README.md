# Mastering GO Lang!

### The traditional program, "Hello World!"

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
The keyword “import” is used for importing a package into other packages.
In our first program we have imported the package “fmt” for using the function Println. 
Println is the function used to print strings in "go" similar to `print()` in Python.
The package “fmt” comes from the Go standard library.
