/*

In Go we declare variables using the keyword `var` followed by the variable name,
the typecasting is done automaticaly else the datatype can be declared after the
variable name.

Go Lang has four main datatypes namely,

* Boolean
* Numeric
* String
* Derived

In each of the datatypes we have different allocations such as (true, false, uint8, uint16...)
In dervied we have special datatypes consisting all pointers, arrays, unions, functions,
slices, interfaces, maps and few other.
